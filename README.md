# python_line_crawler
This crawls all the lines in a directory to search for a keyword and returns the location 
of file which it has been found in and also the number of matched files found.

Suppose you are reading source code of a software but need to look for a file
which contains the definition of some function_name, but the source code is too
big to look into each and every file. Here, python_line_crawler comes handy.

just open the script and run it using python3

Terninal commad for that is:
        python3 findline.py
        
As it starts to execute it will ask for keyword to be searched and the directory
to look in. 

And there you go.
